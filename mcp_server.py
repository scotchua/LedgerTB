"""LedgerTB MCP server — locally authorized assistant access to the books.

Lets an MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code) query a LedgerTB database:
trial balance, statements, general ledger, entry search, integrity checks.

Access model, in order:
- Opt-in: the user must click "Enable assistant access" on the Data Safety
  page for each book while it is unlocked. That stores the derived database
  KEY (never the passphrase) and encrypted book identity in the OS credential
  vault; this server reads them back. Disabling deletes them. No matching
  vault entry -> this server refuses access.
- Permissioned by construction: every tool re-reads the enablement and access
  level from the credential vault, and SQLite's authorizer enforces that level
  for each new connection.
- Local: stdio transport only. Nothing listens on a network port.

Run from source:      python mcp_server.py
Run from the bundle:  LEDGERTB_MODE=mcp <LedgerTB binary>
