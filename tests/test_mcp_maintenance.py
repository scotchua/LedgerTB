"""The maintenance lock as the real MCP tools actually exercise it.

The previous tests drove a generic get_cursor(commit=True) block, which every
mutation was assumed to pass through. It is not: the model layer commits on raw
connections, so posting an entry never entered the guard and the lost-write race
stayed reachable behind a green suite. These call the tools themselves.
