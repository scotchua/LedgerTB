; Inno Setup script for the LedgerTB Windows installer.
;
; WHY AN INSTALLER AND NOT A ZIP
; When Windows extracts a downloaded zip, it stamps every extracted file with
; "mark-of-the-web" (Zone.Identifier, ZoneId=3 — the Internet zone). The .NET
; Framework refuses to load a managed assembly carrying that tag, so the
; bundled Python.Runtime.dll would not load, pywebview's Windows backend could
; not start, and LedgerTB died with a Python traceback before any window
; appeared. Observed on a clean Windows 11 machine, 2026-08-05.
;
; An installer writes the files itself, so nothing lands tagged and the app
; simply runs. It also gives a Start Menu entry and a real uninstall, which is
; what a firm's IT person expects to see.
;
; PER-USER, NO ADMIN PROMPT
; PrivilegesRequired=lowest installs under the user's own AppData instead of
; Program Files. Accountants on managed firm laptops often cannot clear an
; admin prompt, and needing one turns "try this" into "file a ticket".
;
; BUILD
;   iscc /DAppVersion=1.0.0 scripts\ledgertb.iss
; Expects the PyInstaller output at dist\LedgerTB\ relative to the repo root.

[Setup]
; Stable AppId — never change it, or upgrades install alongside the old copy
; instead of replacing it. This is LedgerTB's own identity, minted fresh at
; the rename: ProBooks was never publicly released, so there is no installed
; base to upgrade in place, and the one test install gets uninstalled by hand.
