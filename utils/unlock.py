"""Passphrase gate for the encrypted database, and the book-file chooser.

LedgerTB encrypts its SQLite database with SQLCipher. The key is derived from a
passphrase entered at launch and held only in this process -- never written to
disk or the OS keychain (see database/connection). Every page calls
require_unlock() right after st.set_page_config; until the passphrase is set the
page renders only the gate and stops.

The gate is satisfied by the *process* holding an active key, not by session
state, so one unlock covers the whole launch (and the pytest ``db`` fixture,
which sets a key directly, transparently passes the gate).

Firm mode: the gate is also where a different BOOK FILE is chosen (a firm can
keep book files on a shared drive, ProSystem-style). Opening a book takes an
in-use lock beside the file; if someone else holds it, the opener chooses
read-only or takeover. See utils/books.py and utils/book_lock.py.

       separate process that this one cannot stop, and rewriting its vault entry
       would not invalidate a key already loaded in it, so the requirement is
       that it be switched off first rather than fixed up afterwards.
    2. Take a verified backup keyed with the NEW passphrase, before the live
       book is touched. If anything later fails, that is a recovery point which
       opens with the passphrase the user just chose. A backup under the old one
       would be no help to the person this feature exists for, who may never
       have known it.
    3. Re-encrypt and swap (database.crypto.change_passphrase).
    4. Only then publish the new key to this process, so no query can open the
       new key against the old file or the reverse.
    5. Everything after that point is a follow-up, not a precondition. A failure
       there is a warning naming what to do, never a report that the passphrase
       did not change: it did, and telling someone otherwise is how they end up
       recording the wrong one.

    The current passphrase is not requested. The session may have been opened
    from a remembered key by someone who never knew it, which is the main
    situation this rescues.

    What a clean return does NOT prove: that no other machine was writing, that
    old backups cannot still be opened with the previous passphrase, or that no
    other process still holds the old key. Callers must not present it as such.
