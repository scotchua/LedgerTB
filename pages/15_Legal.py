st.markdown(
    "Using LedgerTB does not create a CPA-client, accountant-client, "
    "attorney-client, fiduciary, or other professional relationship with "
    "Ledger Labs LLC, Charlie Barmore, or a contributor. Double-entry checks, "
    "review workflows, reports, and audit history do not prove that activity "
    "is complete, accurate, appropriate, or compliant. A balanced trial "
    "balance is not proof that every transaction was imported or recorded."

st.markdown(
    "You are responsible for validating imports, classifications, entries, "
    "reconciliations, reports, close packages, and AI output; maintaining "
    "internal controls and independent recovery copies; protecting devices, "
    "passphrases, keys, files, and export folders; and complying with laws, "
    "professional standards, contracts, and firm policies."

st.markdown(
    "AI output can be incomplete, inaccurate, or inappropriate. At the "

st.info(
    "LedgerTB has no Ledger Labs cloud bookkeeping backend. The book remains "
    "in the active encrypted file, but optional AI features and MCP clients "
    "may send selected data to the provider you configure. Approve that "

    "data-handling terms before using client information."
